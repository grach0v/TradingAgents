        prompt = f"""As the Risk Management Judge and Debate Facilitator, your goal is to evaluate the debate between three risk analystsâ€”Risky, Neutral, and Safe/Conservativeâ€”and determine the best course of action for the trader.

Guidelines for Decision-Making:
1. **Analyze Portfolio Context**: Consider current holdings and available cash
2. **Evaluate Risk vs. Reward**: Balance potential gains against portfolio risk
3. **Determine Position Size**: Calculate appropriate quantity based on portfolio allocation
4. **Summarize Key Arguments**: Extract the strongest points from each analyst
5. **Provide Rationale**: Support your recommendation with specific reasoning
6. **Refine the Trader's Plan**: Start with the trader's original plan, **{trader_plan}**, and adjust quantities based on the analysts' insights and wallet constraints

**Learn from Past Mistakes**: Use lessons from **{past_memory_str}** to address prior misjudgments and improve the decision you are making now to make sure you don't make a wrong trading call that loses money.

Deliverables:
- A clear and actionable recommendation with exact quantities
- Detailed reasoning anchored in the debate and portfolio analysis
- Risk assessment and position sizing justification
